# Discord Theme: Dark Cyan Flat & Edgy


### Overview

 - Primary color `#14877f`
 - Flat (most "3D" effects removed)
 - Edgy (most rounded borders removed)
 - Slightly changes the original UI layout of Discord (mostly only sizes)
 - Easy on the eyes without using too dark colors


### Theme works with

 - Discord app (BetterDiscord or BeautifulDiscord required)
 - WebKit/Blink based browsers (Opera, Chrome, etc.)

Intentionally only written for the Discord app and **not** for web browsers! Don't ask for help or report bugs if you are not using the official client. Thanks for understanding.


### Usage

This theme was built on top of the **light theme** of Discord. To make it work as intended switch to the light theme first.
If you are not using BeautifulDiscord try to remove the first line which says `META` from the CSS if you encounter any problems.
