# Discord Theme: Dark Cyan Flat & Edgy


### Overview

 - Primary color `#14877f`
 - Flat (most "3D" effects removed)
 - Edgy (most rounded borders removed)
 - Doesn't change the original UI layout of Discord
 - Easy on the eyes without using too dark colors


### Theme works with

 - Discord app (BetterDiscord or BeautifulDiscord required)
 - WebKit/Blink based browsers (Opera, Chrome, etc.)

Intentionally only written for the Discord app and **not** for web browsers! Don't ask for help or report bugs if you are not using the official client. Thanks for understanding.


### Usage

This theme was built on top of the **light theme** of Discord. To make it work as intended switch to the light theme first.
If you are not using BetterDiscord remove the first line which says `META` from the CSS.

### Changelog

#### v0.7 - `Incomplete`

 - Initial public release



This theme is not yet finished and there are still some bugs due to bad CSS selections.
I'm still trying to understand the layout of Discord and how it works. Some things are
not yet themed and may look not very nice.

All the primary and most used UI elements are done though :smile:
